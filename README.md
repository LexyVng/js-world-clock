# JS WORLD CLOCK
The JS World Clock is a web application that displays the current date and time of different timezones. The user can also select a city from the drop-down menu and view the date and time of that city. The data is retrieved from the library `Moment js`.

## Motivation

The main goal of the project was to demonstrate the use of the library `Moment js` to retrieve real-time data for various timezones.

## Features

- A homepage which includes a drop-down menu and the data of 3 different timezones
- The drop-down menu was built using the `<select>` element and the `<optgroup>` element to group the cities based on their continent
- Once the user selects a city from the drop-down menu:
  - all content will be replaced by the date and time of the selected city
  - a button will become available to redirect the user to the homepage
